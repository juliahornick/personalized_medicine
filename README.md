  Mutations may be caused by mistakes during cell division, or they may be caused by exposure to DNA-damaging agents in the environment. 
  Mutations can be harmful, beneficial, or have no effect. If they occur in cells that make eggs or sperm, they can be inherited; if mutations occur in other types of cells, they are not inherited. 
Certain mutations may lead to cancer or other diseases. A mutation is sometimes called a variant.
